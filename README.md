# My Personal Blog 🌐

Welcome to my personal blog! 

This is a space where I share my journey and experiences with **Linux programming** 🖥️ and various **experiments in my lab** 🔬.

You’ll also find some of my **poetry** ✍️, which I highly recommend if you’re interested.

I hope to see you [there](https://defnotfreddie.com/)! 😉
